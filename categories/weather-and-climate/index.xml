      <description>In a world experiencing climate change, good weather and climate data matters. It may be available but often hard to find, understand and apply to decision-making mainly because:
There are no weather stations everywhereWeather stations are not in good condition (gaps)The data is not stored correctlyThe data does not pass the basic quality controlsAccess to data is restrictedHowever, weather and climate data products derived from satellites and model-based reanalysis have been used in locations where station based observations are inadequate or incomplete.</description>
